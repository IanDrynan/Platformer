# Platformer
Simple 2D platformer using Unity3D with orthographic view. 

I'm using Unity3D instead of 2D because I wanted to focus more on 3D and I have more interest in 3D games instead of sprite based 2D games. 

For this project the goal is to make a simple platformer with controls that feel snappy.  Since I intend to deploy this to Android,
(though not necessarily onto the app store), design choices are made with this in mind. The topics I intend to learn more about with this project are rigidbody physics manipulation, UI(specifically how to do so for a mobile game), and level design. 

I am a big fan of difficult games so my intention is to make the game challenging(but fair!).

Goals:

1. Movement should feel fair and responsive --- Core mechanics are done, 1 bug remains and tweaking values 
2. Multiple levels that scale in difficulty introducing new concepts --- Not Yet
3. Stage select and other UI elements will be last priority --- Not Yet

Optional:

1. Visuals
2. More levels
